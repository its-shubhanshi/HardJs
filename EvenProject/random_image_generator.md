# 🖼️ Task: Random Image Generator

## 🎯 Problem Statement
You need to build a simple web project where images appear randomly on the screen when a button is clicked.

---

## 📌 Requirements
1. Add a **button** on the web page.  
2. Create a **container (div)** where images will appear.  
3. Every time the button is clicked:  
   - A new image should be created dynamically.  
   - The image should be placed at a **random position** within the container.  
   - The image should have a **random rotation** (0° to 360°).  
4. All previously created images should remain visible.  
5. The task must be done using **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.

---

## 🚀 Bonus (Optional Enhancements)
- Use an **array of multiple images** and pick one randomly.  
- Randomize the **size** of each image.  
- Add a **fade-in / animation effect** when the image appears.
