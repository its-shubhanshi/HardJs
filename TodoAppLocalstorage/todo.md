# Todo List App Task

- Create a Todo List application where a user can add tasks.  
- Tasks should be displayed in a list format on the page.  
- Every task added should be saved in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`.  
- When the page is refreshed, previously added tasks should still be visible.  
- (Optional) Add functionality to delete individual tasks from the list and update `localStorage` accordingly.
