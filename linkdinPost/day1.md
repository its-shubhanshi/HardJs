# ðŸŒŸ Day 1 of My JavaScript Journey! ðŸŒŸ

Today, I started exploring **JavaScript fundamentals** â€” variables and console output. ðŸ’»

## Variable Declarations
- **`var`** â€“ function-scoped, can be redeclared.  
- **`let`** â€“ block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared.  
- **`const`** â€“ block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared.

## Logging to the Console
- **`console.log()`** helps you see your programâ€™s output, debug, and learn interactively.

```javascript
var age = 25;
let name = "Aradhya";
const country = "India";

console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("Country:", country);
