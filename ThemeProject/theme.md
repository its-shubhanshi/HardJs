# Task: Theme Switcher with Dark/Light Mode

## Problem Statement
Create a theme switcher for a webpage that allows users to toggle between **dark mode** and **light mode** using a switch button.

## Requirements
1. Add a **switch button** that changes the theme.
2. The switch should show:
   - ðŸŒ™ when the theme is in **dark mode**
   - ðŸŒž when the theme is in **light mode**
3. Save the userâ€™s selected theme in **localStorage**.
4. When the page is reloaded, the theme should remain the same as the last selected option.
5. Add smooth transitions so that switching between themes feels natural.

## Expected Behavior
- On first load, the default theme should be **dark**.
- When the switch is toggled, the theme should update instantly.
- Refreshing the page should keep the theme consistent with the last chosen mode.
